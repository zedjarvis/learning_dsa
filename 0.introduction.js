const algorithm = "A set of step-by-step instruction to solve a specific problem."
const data_structure = "A way of organizing data so that it can be used efficiently."
const time_complexity = "A measure of the amount of time an algorithm takes to run, depending on the amount of data the algorithm is working on."
const space_complexity = "A measure of the amount of memory an algorithm uses, depending on the amount of data the algorithm is working on."
const big_o_notation = "A mathematical notation that describes the limiting behaviour of a function when the argument tends towards a particular value or infinity. Used to describe the time complexity of an algorithm."
const recursion = "A programming technique where a function calls itself."
const divide_and_conquer = "A method of solving complex problems by breaking them into smaller, more manageable sub-problems, solving the sub-problems, and combining the solutions. Recursion is often used when using this method in an algorithm."
const brute_force = "A simple and straight forward way an algorithm can work by simply trying all posible solutions and then choosing the best one."
